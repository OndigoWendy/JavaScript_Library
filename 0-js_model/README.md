An overview of the way we use JavaScript throughout the rest of
the book. 
A programming style that is common to many programmers
who are accustomed to using C-style languages such as C++ and Java.
 Of course, Java‚Äê
Script has many conventions that do not follow the rules of those languages, and we
certainly point those out (such as the declaration and use of variables) and show you
the correct way to use the language. We also follow as many of the good JavaScript
programming practices outlined by authors such as John Resig, Douglas Crockford,
and others as we can. As responsible programmers, we need to keep in mind that it is
just as important that our programs be readable by humans as it is that they be correctly
executed by computers
