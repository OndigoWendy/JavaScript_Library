1. Arrays
What's an Array? The way I visualize it is a table. Below is an example of how an array would look like.

index	value
0	this is the first value, stored at zero position
1	the index of an array runs in sequence
2	this could be useful for storing data that are required to be ordered, such as rankings or queues
3	in JavaScript, array's value could be mixed; meaning value of each index could be of different data, be it String, Number or even Objects
