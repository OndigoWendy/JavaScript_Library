Think of objects as a logical grouping of a bunch of properties. Properties could be some variable that it's storing or some methods that it's using. I also visualize an object as a table. The main difference is that object's "index" need not be numbers and is not necessarily sequenced.


**properties** | **Value** | 
----------|:----------:|
name |"I'm an object"
data|	["You can add an array as a property", "Recall that array is a sequenced list of items", "but just because it's sequenced, doesn't means you can only use it for that purpose"]
function_name |	function(parameters){//do something}
